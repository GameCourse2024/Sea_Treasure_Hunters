# Dramatic Elements

## 1. Challenge

The skills needed to play our game will be creativity, solving quests and combat related skills, the player can choose in the start of the game easy, medium or hard that will directly affect enemy Hit Points, player stats and sailing parameters. Each island will have its own story quests and bosses. Travelling islands before completing the whole quest line, indicating a player is of high level will be accounted for and parameters of enemy bosses will be adjusted accordingly.

## 3. Plaything

The player can roam the island freely interacting with inhabitants and attacking enemies that aren’t relevant to the story line, this game is intended to be built for players that like to scout, scouting each island and interacting with it fully, players that like to collect various items and upgrades they don't necessarily need by completing side quests and defeating high level bosses and those that want to be immersed in a rich story.

## 4. Feelings

We expect the player to build a connection with each island he visits by throwing him into a rich story and the quests guide him to ultimately saving each island in its own story. The game will be built with a lot of gut-wrenching cut scenes and music that will hopefully successfully make the player feel the emotions that the game tries to convey.

## 5. BackStory

There was a pirate who once owned everything the world has to offer, no government body or navy could catch this pirate, being as strong as he is no other person alive was strong enough to capture him, eventually he turned himself in, but only in order to start a great age of pirates by giving them a clue to where his amassed treasure was left. This will all be told to the player through cut-scenes.

#### Island 1: Ember Island

Ember Island was once a thriving island currently on the brink of disaster, the volcano Mount Pyrrhus is about to erupt and is large enough to erase the whole island and its inhabitants. The Emberians believe an artifact called the Flameheart can calm down the volcano, the protagonist arrives to find it and calm the volcano down.

#### Island 2: Zephyr Zenith

After defeating him and earning the final treasure we reach home to discover we arrived too late and our family has already been doomed.


## 8. World building

The currency in the world is money known as “ cheseph “, while the laws of physics mainly are the same as the real world, each island will have its own geography, history and politics.

#### Ember Island:
With fire that seems out of control everywhere yet is actually controlled in harmony with the Emberians, the ember island is governed by a main priest that religiously believes in the volcano and its needs. The Emberians have been living in harmony with the fire around them for centuries believing it is keeping them safe.

#### Zephyr Zenith:
The whole island will be floating by a zephyr that keeps it high in the air. The residents will be tranquil people, very calm and at ease till trouble arises. The people centuries ago used to be so violent that the rest of the continent decided the best way to deal with them is to send their homeland into the air and never come back down. The zenith’s are known for being atheists and big believers of science.

#### Verdant Enclave:
The enclave is a huge forest booming with exotic plants, waterfalls and amazing animals, the Verdantians are loving and not very smart people, they love the animals and enjoy the pure things in life, the island is under direct government protection, allowing them to continue their worry free lifestyle. This is allowed because in the past the Verdantians produced enough food to help fuel the government's war in return for protection. 

#### Isle Of Convergence: 
A ragged island with not a soul managing to survive there besides the antagonist that obtained the same power you did in order to be there. Floating platforms of fire or forestry float around as a symbol to the previous islands. The island's history is unknown till the protagonist finds out the government destroyed the island when the island’s inhabitants found out some dark truth about the world.



All of the above the player will learn through the visual representations of each island and through dialogue with inhabitants of the island, islands that don’t have inhabitants will have scrolls and half burned books that will explain extra about the island they are exploring.
