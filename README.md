## Official Components



### 1. Players

This game is designed for 14-20 year olds that don't need previous experience and are ok at games. It is a singleplayer game.


### 2. Goals

The player needs to proceed through islands till he reaches the last island, the player will know he is proceeding when the next island unlocks for him.



### 3. Procedures

The player will first be thrown into an action scene with a guide explaining the buttons needed to move, interact and fight. After seeing a cut-scene about how everyone is finding the great treasure. The player will need to keep on advancing through islands till reaching his final destination by sailing to the final island and defeating the final boss.



### 4. Rules

The player cannot sail to a new island before completing a main mission given to him on the island he is currently on, neither can the player sail back so think hard before advancing the player will be warned about this before advancing to a new island.


### 5. Resources

The games resources will be points he can decide to put into strength, hitpoints, defense and navigation besides that he will use gold as currency allowing him to buy crewmates and repair or buy ships and better armour or weapons. The player will earn these by completing island missions and defeating evil pirates, the harder the missions and pirates the more curreny it will drop, these stats and gold will be displayed on screen at all times for the player to see and explained in depth in a tutorial.

### 6. Confrontation

The confrontations in this game will be between the player and his surroundings, fish attacking the ship and pirates raiding islands you need to defend, the player will also have a dillema each time he wants to move on to a new island making sure he left nothing behind.




### 7. Bounds

The bounds of the game will be each time the island you are in, you won't be able to walk into the sea by yourself and the navigation to the next island will be a fixed path not allowing you to steer off it. when ou try steering too far to one side the game will correct you back to the right path, not allowing you to steer wherever you want. There will be a minimap showing your location and points of interest near you.

### 8. Results

The game will punish you for death resetting your characters resources, but the game is progress based so reaching the end will always be a possibility.

Sid Meier's Pirates is not only interfaces, but very heavyily influenced by interfaces and click decision making as opposed to going and doing it by yourself that leads once again to a loss in sense of exploration.

The game Lost At Sea is about building your own island in the sea in order to survive in a world on your own, our game differs by exploring inhabited island and giving you the option of saving them or saving individuals giving you a sense of accomplishment for saving others, that this game doesn't.
