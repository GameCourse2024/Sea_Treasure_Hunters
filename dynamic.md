# Sea Treasure Hunters

## 1. Key Characteristics of Game Entities

In our game, we considered specific numbers to provide a challenging experience for the player, assuming they don't fully explore every location. This approach rewards players with upgrades if they decide to explore the world like we want them to. The key parameters in our game include:
- Missions per island with respect to their difficulty.
- Enemy boss hitpoints.
- Player stats.

## 2. Locations of Key Items

Key items needed for quests are scattered in remote locations across the islands. These items are only requested by NPCs if the player chooses to interact with them. This design encourages players to explore and rewards them with higher stats and smoother progression.

## 3. Main Behaviors of Entities

Entities in Sea Treasure Hunters include regular NPCs, enemy NPCs, boss NPCs, and creatures. NPCs generally roam or patrol, depending on if they are aggressive attackable NPC's or just regular interactable NPC's. Non-aggressive NPCs can be interacted with to receive quests, information about the world, or just random conversation. Aggressive NPCs will attack upon detection. Creatures mainly roam and are mostly non-aggressive, but some can pose a challenge to the player.

## 4. Economic System

Sea Treasure Hunters features a simple economic system with the currency "keseph." Keseph is used to purchase ships, hitpoint-enhancing potions, and other items. Money is deducted for deaths and penalties.

## 5. Player Information

Players always have access to their stats, health points, and gold. To learn more about the world and missions, players must explore, interact with NPCs, and defeat enemies.

## 6. Player Control

Players have real-time control over their character's movements, including attacking, jumping and free roaming movement, directly impacting gameplay.

## 7. Player Choices

Players must decide when to move to the next island, which NPCs to interact with, which enemies to defeat, and which missions or quests to pursue. Choices significantly impact gameplay and progression.
